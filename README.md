## Features

- **Native Cross-Platform Performance**: Built with .NET and Avalonia UI - no Electron, no browser overhead, just fast native performance on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Fully Offline with Local Storage**: Works completely offline with collections stored as files on your local file system - own your data, sync with Git, backup however you want
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support**: Real-time streaming response handling with automatic parsing, grouping, and live updates
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Organize requests in nested folders that map directly to your file system structure
- **Developer-Friendly**: Keyboard shortcuts, request cloning, syntax highlighting, and JSON formatting for efficient workflow
- **Privacy-First**: No telemetry, no cloud dependencies, no data collection - your API tests stay on your machine
